<sub>*Computer Engineering undergrad student* at Universidade Federal da Paraíba</sub>

Hey, I'm João Pedro. (Since it's a complicated name to pronounce in english, you can call me JP)

I'm from São Paulo, Brazil. Though, I have spent most of my life where I currently live João Pessoa, Brazil.

I'm a Computer Engineering Undergrad student at the [Federal University of Paraíba](https://www.ufpb.br), and a Machine Learning Researcher at [ArIA - Artificial Intelligence Applications Laboratory](https://aria.ci.ufpb.br), where I've been studying Artificial Intelligence for the past months.

Outside of computer science, I enjoy learning random stuff, traveling, playing Dungeons & Dragons, and caffeine :)

**Background in:** C/C++, Python, Machine Learning, Data Analysis.
